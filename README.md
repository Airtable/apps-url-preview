When the user selects a record in grid view, this block gets a preview URL from the record and shows
the corresponding preview. This block supports previews from the following services: YouTube, Vimeo,
Spotify, Soundcloud, and Figma.

The code shows:

-   How to use the Cursor API to detect when a user has selected a record in grid view, and how to
    get the selected record.
