# URL preview app

When the user selects a record in grid view, this app gets a preview URL from the record and shows
the corresponding preview. This app supports previews from the following services: YouTube, Vimeo,
Spotify, Soundcloud, and Figma.

The code shows:

-   How to use the Cursor API to detect when a user has selected a record in grid view, and how to
    get the selected record.

-   How to embed content in a app.

## How to run this app

1. Create a new base (or you can use an existing base).

2. Create a new app in your new base (see
   [Create a new app](https://airtable.com/developers/blocks/guides/hello-world-tutorial#create-a-new-app)),
   selecting "URL preview" as your template.

3. From the root of your new app, run `block run`.
